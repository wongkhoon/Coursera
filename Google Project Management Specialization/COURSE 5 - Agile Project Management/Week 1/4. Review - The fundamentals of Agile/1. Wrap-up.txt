Way to go! You made it through
a whirlwind introductory tour of Agile. We covered the history of Agile, the
Agile Manifesto, and the four values and 12 principles of Agile. We explored when and
why to adopt an Agile mindset. You learned about VUCA and how to use the concept to assess which
approach to take with your project. You also learn some Agile friendly
methodologies: Kanban, XP, and Lean. Finally, you learn how to blend these
methods with traditional Waterfall practices. Then, you returned to Office Green as the
project manager of a new Agile project: Virtual Verde. That's a lot. Congrats on making it through the first
part of your Agile journey, and there's more fun to be had. I'll meet up with you in
the next set of videos.
