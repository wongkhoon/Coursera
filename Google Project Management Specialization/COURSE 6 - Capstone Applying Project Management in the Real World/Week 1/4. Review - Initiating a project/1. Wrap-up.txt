Hi. Congrats on making it
to the end of this section. Let's take a moment to review what you've accomplished so far. You started by analyzing
documents, conducting research, and applying strategic
thinking to complete the project charter for Sauce and Spoon's tablet rollout project. Next, you use the project
charter as a tool to align the project's scope and goals among key stakeholders. Then you completed your own
stakeholder analysis and learned how to use one when preparing for project
negotiations. You also identified aspects of a project that often
require negotiation, along with aspects that provide benefits
that could support a mutually beneficial agreement that works for all stakeholders. Finally, you applied
your knowledge of power and interest to identify people to be part of
a coalition aimed at persuading stakeholders
to a certain viewpoint. Defining and getting stakeholders aligned with the details, negotiating project
scope and goals, and being able to effectively
influence others are super important to getting off to a successful start
in any project. It's here in the beginning
that you want to get clear on what you're setting out to accomplish with the project. That way, you'll be able to accurately track the
project's progress and feel confident you're
working within the time frame and
budget allowed. Being able to practice these concepts, create
project documentation, and apply this knowledge
will help you prepare for job interviews and become
a great project manager. Coming up next, you'll
continue to learn from Peta in her role as project
manager for Sauce and Spoon. In the upcoming activities, you'll take the work
you've done here and move into the planning phase
of the project to build out a project plan with tasks and milestones. Meet you there.
