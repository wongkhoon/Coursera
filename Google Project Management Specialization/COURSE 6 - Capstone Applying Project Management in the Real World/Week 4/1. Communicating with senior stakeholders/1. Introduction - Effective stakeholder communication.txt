Hey there. In the upcoming
activities we'll continue the project execution phase and then transition to
the closing phase of the project life cycle. You'll demonstrate your ability to communicate with stakeholders by writing an email about a problem to a
senior stakeholder. You'll also demonstrate
your ability to wrap up a project by creating a closeout report to present the project impact to
executive stakeholders. As you've learned
throughout this program, communication is a vital part of effective project management. That's why in the coming
activities we'll have you practice observing
communication between the Sauce & Spoon team. Based on those observations, you'll execute various
communication techniques, including drafting
emails to stakeholders, creating a closeout report, and writing an executive summary. At the end of this course, you'll take what you've
learned and create your own personal
impact report to reflect on your experience
with this program. Ready to get started? Meet me in the next
video to discuss communicating about
project problems.
