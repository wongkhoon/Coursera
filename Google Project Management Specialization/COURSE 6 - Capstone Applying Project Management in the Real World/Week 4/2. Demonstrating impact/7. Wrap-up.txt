Hi again, and congrats on reaching the end
of this course. So far you've used the skills you learned in previous videos to execute the entire life cycle of our example project
with Sauce and Spoon. First, in the initiation phase, you learned how to create
a project charter, and then you identified project
goals and deliverables. You demonstrated how to conduct a stakeholder analysis to prepare for negotiations
with stakeholders. Then you went into the
planning phase where you determine tasks in order to accomplish the
goals set forth. You learned the value of holding team brainstorms in order
to ensure all tasks were included and we explored
some techniques for creating accurate time estimates
for each of those tasks. As you moved from the planning
to the execution phase, you started executing tasks as part of quality management, where you set quality
standards and measured quality
with user surveys. Next up was the closing phase
where you learned how to connect problems to project
goals by creating OKRs. You learned the importance
of a closeout report. Finally, you learned about impact reporting and how to write a great executive summary so that your senior stakeholders
can quickly understand the impact
of your project. In the next video, we'll wrap up the whole program and apply the knowledge
you've gained to taking the next step in your project management
career. See you soon.
