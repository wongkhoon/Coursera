Hey, there. In this module, we moved from the
planning phase of the project lifecycle
to the execution phase. You practiced quality
management by defining quality standards
for your project. Then you evaluated how
successfully the project standards were being met and presented your findings to stakeholders. You also created a
retrospective document. We also went deeper into some concepts you
learned earlier and introduced a few new approaches,
methods, and techniques. Along the way, you navigated
negotiations, escalations, and conversations with
people in different roles, with different priorities
and personalities. Finally, you picked up
techniques for handling retrospectives when they don't
go as smoothly as planned. You learned how to
navigate through lack of accountability, lack
of participation, and negativity in
retrospectives, which helped you draft your
own retrospective for Sauce & Spoon to add to your
portfolio of artifacts. Great job. Now it's time
to learn even more. Meet you back here for
the next set of lessons.
