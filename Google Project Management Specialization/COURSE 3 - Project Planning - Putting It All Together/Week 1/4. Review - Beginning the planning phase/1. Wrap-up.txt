Hi again. Over the past few videos, we've discussed how to launch the planning
phase of the project life cycle. This is where you'll build your schedule,
set your budget, and prepare your risk management plan. You also learned about an important
part of the planning phase: the project kickoff meeting. This is a key moment where you
can meet with your team and stakeholders to establish a shared vision,
align on scope, build rapport, ask questions, and set expectations. We also discussed milestones, which
are important points within the project schedule that indicate progress. And we also learned about tasks, which are activities that need to be
accomplished within a set period of time. Then you learned about the value
of milestones and how to set them. And you learned how to take those
milestones, break them down into tasks, and record that information in
a work breakdown structure. Next, we'll explore estimating time and
setting a schedule. See you soon.
