Nice work! Let's recap
what we've just covered. First, we took you
through why it's necessary to create and
manage a project plan. At the center of the project
plan is a project schedule, and we discussed methods
for determining realistic time and effort
estimates for each task. You also learned more about the power of soft skills to help you gather time and
effort estimates from members of your team. We also introduced
you to a Gantt chart, which is a useful tool for visualizing a project schedule. And, I shared my best practices for creating a project plan
that will serve as a useful source of
information throughout the planning phase
and execution phase. Coming up, we'll take you through managing costs and
budgets. See you soon.
