Hi. Welcome back. In the previous section, we learned more about
the planning phase which is the second phase
of the project life cycle. We introduced you
to kickoff meetings, which is the first meeting
for the project team. We also discussed milestones, tasks, and how to set
these within a project. Coming up, we'll
explain why it is necessary to create and
manage a project plan. We'll discuss the definition of a project plan, and we'll learn what typically goes into one. This includes the
project schedule, which will help guide your
team to the finish line. We'll also share how to use time estimation methods to
prevent project failure. We'll introduce you to a few time estimation techniques which can help you build an
accurate project schedule. Finally, we'll examine tools and best practices you can use
to build out a project plan. Ready to get started? Meet me in the next video.
