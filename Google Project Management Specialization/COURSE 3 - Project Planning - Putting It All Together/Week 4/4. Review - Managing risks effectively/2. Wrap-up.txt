Nice work. Let's recap what
we've discussed so far. You learned about risks, which are potential events that could impact your project. You also learned how
risks differ from issues, which are known and
real problems that may affect the ability to
complete a certain task. I introduced you to
risk management, which is the process
of identifying potential risks and issues
that could impact a project, and evaluating and applying steps to address their effects. We've discussed brainstorming as a technique for
identifying risks, and I introduced you to tools you can use to identify, assess, and document risks, like a
probability and impact matrix, a risk register, and a
risk management plan. Finally, we discussed
the importance of communicating risks to
your stakeholders in order to set expectations
and demonstrate your work to plan for and mitigate potential problems
with the project. Coming up, we'll discuss documentation and
communication. See you soon.
