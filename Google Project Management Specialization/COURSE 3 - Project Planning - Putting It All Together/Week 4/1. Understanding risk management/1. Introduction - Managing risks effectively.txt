Welcome back. Earlier, we covered managing costs
and a project budget. We discussed what the components
of a project budget are, how the budget process works, and how to track and
estimate a budget. You also learned about
the procurement process. Coming up, we will discuss risk management and why it's important to help
prevent project failure. Knowing how to anticipate
and alleviate, (commonly known as mitigate) the potential problems is your best bet for keeping
a project on track. You will learn how to define and relate risk management
concepts and explain how risk management can help protect your
project from failing. You'll also identify risk types and how to measure
their impact on a project and
communicate and resolve identified risks using
a mitigation plan. Ready to get started? Great. Meet me in the next video.
