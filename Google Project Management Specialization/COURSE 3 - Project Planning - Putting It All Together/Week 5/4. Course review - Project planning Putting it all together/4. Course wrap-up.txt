You've done a lot of work so far. Let's take a moment to review all you learned
in this course. First, you learned
the key components of the planning phase and explored how proper
planning ensures that milestones and
tasks are completed. Next, you learned why it is necessary to create and
manage a project plan, how to utilize time
estimation methods to prevent project failure, how to get viable estimates
using soft skills, and which tools you can use
to build a project plan. Then you learned what the components of a
project budget are, how the budget process works, and the concepts behind estimating and tracking
a project budget. We discussed how the
procurement process flows to manage paperwork, bids, proposals, and performance. You also learned
about risk management and how it helps prevent
project failure. You learned how to identify risks and measure their
impact on a project and how to communicate
and monitor potential risks once
they're identified. Finally, you learned how important it is to
document plans. You learned how to organize plans to provide visibility
and accountability and what elements of a simple communication plan
are vital to project success. In the next course, you'll continue on to executing and closing a project
where my colleague, Elita, will be your guide. She's going to
teach you all about tracking and measuring
project progress, risk management,
using data to make decisions, and effective
project communication. I had a wonderful time sharing my project management experience
with you. Best of luck.
