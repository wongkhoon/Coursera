Welcome back. Before we move on, let's recap what's
already been covered. You learned how to define
project management, what a project is, what it isn't, and how to explain its value to businesses. You also discussed when and why it's necessary to have
a project manager, the role in day-to-day
responsibilities of a project manager, and the core skills needed to be a successful project manager. Now is a good time to stop and recognize how
much you've learned. By now you're familiar with the job of project management, and you've started
learning what it takes to be an effective
project manager. Now you'll go a little further, and learn some of the
ins and outs of the job, and before you know it, you'll be ready to guide any project successfully.
Are you ready? Well, coming up, I'll
introduce you to the two most popular
approaches to project management,
Waterfall and Agile. We'll also cover the project
management life cycle and phases, and you'll learn
about the different styles, scenarios, and factors
that can impact a project and its tasks at any given phase. When we're done, you'll be
able to explain and follow the life cycle of a project, define and outline
a project's phases, and each phase's tasks, compare different project
management methodologies to determine which methodology is most effective for a
project, and finally, organize how a project is run, according to different program
management methodologies. Ready? Let's get started.
