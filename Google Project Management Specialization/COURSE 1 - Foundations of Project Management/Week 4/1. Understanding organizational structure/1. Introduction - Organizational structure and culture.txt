Hey there, how are you feeling so far? We're nearing the end of this course. And honestly, you've done a great job. Previously, we talked about the life
cycle of a project, the task breakdown of phases, and some

execute your project. I'll describe some common
types of structures that you're likely to encounter during
your project management career. You'll also learn about change management, which refers to the way you present
the final project to the organization and get them to accept and
implement your project outcome. These are important elements to ensure
that your project is adopted and lives on. Are you ready?
Let's get into these concepts.
