Congratulations on
completing Course 1: Foundations of
Project Management. You're off to a strong start. You've just learned a lot of new information
and you're already starting to apply
that knowledge to the field of project management. Let's do a quick recap. In this course, you learned
what project management is along with the role and
value of a project manager. Next, you learned the
life cycle of a project and the tasks to manage a project
from start to finish. Then you learned about different project
management methodologies and tips for choosing the
right method for your project. You also learned how creating simple team connections can lead to a successful
project outcome. Lastly, you learned how organizational
structure and culture can impact your project. These topics provide
the foundation for beginning any new project and you now have the
knowledge and tools to build informed plans and set up
your projects for success. After all, that's why we
created this specialization, to give you, the newbie
project manager, the tools you need to confidently move forward
with your career. This is just the beginning. Keep at it, and you'll have more opportunities to put
your learning into action, and develop the skills
and mindset you need to manage lots
of types of projects. The skills you've
learned so far give you a big picture view of
project management. You'll use these skills
to focus your learning for the next course where
you'll start creating, analyzing, and making decisions about project plans
all on your own. In the next course we're
going to kick off the project life cycle
and break down all you need to know and do, to get a project
off to a great start. It's time for me to say so long. It's been a blast being your guide to
project management and sharing my passion for
projects and people with you. Best of luck. Maybe I'll see
you in a project someday.
