Welcome back. Let's start by reviewing what we've
discussed so far. Earlier, you were introduced to project management
as a career path. We discussed how this
course can help you advance your career goals with a project management
certification. We also discussed some of the basics of project management, like how to define a project and its
different components. Then, we went over some distinct project
management careers, roles, and responsibilities. Now it's time to gain a deeper understanding of
a project manager's role. By the end of this module, you'll be able to explain the unique value a project
manager brings to their team. You'll also be able to describe a project manager's roles
and responsibilities, and list their core skills. This course will
help you continue to recognize the skills that you already have that will help you become a successful
project manager. It will also help you identify new skills that you may need to learn in preparation
for your new career. Ready? Let's get started.
