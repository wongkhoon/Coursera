So far, we've previewed what you can expect
throughout this program. In this video, we'll discuss
the details of this course. And you'll have a greater understanding
for which types of jobs are suitable for
learners like you. We'll cover some key project management terms and the roles and responsibilities of any
entry level project manager. Plus, we'll discuss
the kinds of jobs you can pursue after you
complete this program. One thing you'll learn
soon is that there are other roles and jobs, outside of project manager, that this program will
prepare you for. Later in this course, we'll have a video
on how to search for those roles and how to view project management as both
a position and a skill. For now, we'll start by going even deeper into
what a project is, what a project manager is, and what kinds of
skills they have. We'll provide real
life examples to help illustrate that you probably already have learned
some of the skills required to become a
successful project manager. Then you'll learn
more about adding value to projects
and tips on being a successful project
manager from real life Googlers. Pretty exciting, right? We'll also cover the
project's life cycle. You'll learn all about a
project's different phases, the corresponding
tasks in each phase, different methodologies
for completing tasks and which is effective
for a given project. Finally, you will learn
about different types of organizational
structures and cultures and how they impact
project management. Coming up, we'll start
exploring the concept of a project and the project
management field as a whole. Are you ready to crank things
up a notch? See you soon.
