You're doing great! You've completed this module and
have set yourself up for success. Way to go! Defining goals and managing scope and ensuring a successful landing might
seem tricky to master at first, but the SMART method and
the triple constraint triangle, tools, and methods for measuring success criteria and clear communication will help
you every step of the way. In the next module,
we will talk about the roles and responsibilities that come
along with each project so that everyone knows how they contribute
to reaching the project's goals.
