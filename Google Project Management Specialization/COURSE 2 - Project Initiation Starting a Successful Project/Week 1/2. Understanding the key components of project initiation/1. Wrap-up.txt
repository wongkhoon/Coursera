Nice work! You're on your way to
becoming a great candidate for roles in project management. We're so glad you've stuck with us, and we hope you're proud of
the progress you've made so far. In the last few videos, we've given
you a primer on kicking off a project successfully. To recap, you learned more about initiation,the first phase of
the project life cycle. Hopefully, you're starting to see
how important this phase is for the overall health of a project. As we talked about earlier, a lack of
preparation during the initiation stage can lead to problems later on
in the project life cycle, like a budget shortage, a missed deadline,
or too few teammates to complete the work. But with early planning,
you can set your team up for success. We also introduced you to the major
factors you should consider during the initiation phase,
including goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria,
stakeholders and resources. All of these come together in
the early plans for a project and are documented in a project charter. Now that you understand the basic elements
of initiation, let's dive deeper. Next up, we'll talk about identifying
goals and deliverables and learn more about measurement and
success criteria. You're doing great, and we'll see you soon.
